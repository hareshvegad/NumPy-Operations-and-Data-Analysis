# NumPy Operations and Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code snippets using the NumPy library for numerical operations and basic data analysis. The code snippets cover various aspects such as array creation, element-wise operations, array manipulation, statistical operations, and correlation analysis.

## 1. Element-wise Operations
This script demonstrates basic element-wise operations on NumPy arrays, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also showcases array slicing and manipulation.

## 2. Array Creation and Manipulation
This script illustrates the creation and manipulation of 2D NumPy arrays. It covers array creation, slicing, and various stacking operations (concatenation, vertical stacking, and horizontal stacking).

## 3. Array Information and Type Conversion 
This script provides information about NumPy arrays, such as shape, length, size, type, and data type. It also demonstrates how to perform type conversion on array elements.

## 4. Array Arithmetic and Mathematical Operations
This script showcases basic arithmetic and mathematical operations on NumPy arrays, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root.

## 5. Array Concatenation and Stacking
This script demonstrates various methods for concatenating and stacking NumPy arrays along different axes. It covers both vertical and horizontal stacking.

## 6. Array Splitting
This script shows how to split a NumPy array into sub-arrays using the array_split function. It includes examples of splitting 1D and 2D arrays.

## 7. Array Manipulation - Append, Insert, Delete
This script covers operations like appending, inserting, and deleting elements in NumPy arrays. It includes examples for 1D and 2D arrays, along with axis-specific operations.

## 8. Sorting Arrays
This script demonstrates how to sort NumPy arrays in ascending order. It includes examples for both 1D and 2D arrays, sorting along specific axes.

## 9. Finding Indices and Searchsorted
This script showcases how to use NumPy functions (np.where and np.searchsorted) to find indices based on specific conditions and searchsorted for insertion positions.

## 10. Boolean Indexing
This script demonstrates boolean indexing in NumPy, allowing the selection of elements based on specified conditions.

## 11. Basic Statistical Analysis
This script performs basic statistical analysis on a sample dataset, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance, using both NumPy and the statistics module.

## 12. Correlation Analysis
This script calculates the correlation coefficient matrix for given datasets using NumPy's corrcoef function. It includes examples for different datasets, showcasing the relationship between variables.
